This year’s conference will explore how innovations across various sectors in Africa can influence the global economy.
What role does African innovation play in shaping the global future?
How do current ventures on the continent position Africa to become a leader in the global economy?

At this conference we would like to challenge the narrative that “Africa is the future” and explore whether “Africa is now”.  
We will welcome diverse perspectives on Africa’s unique opportunities
and challenges as our speakers discuss what they see as Africa’s role in today’s economy.
