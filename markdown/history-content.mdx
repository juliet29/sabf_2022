This year marks the 13th anniversary of the Africa Business Forum. 
In 2007, the forum theme was “Fostering Entrepreneurial Activities in Africa”. 
Its objective was to portray Africa in a more positive light than that more 
commonly seen in the media and create awareness of the diverse and burgeoning opportunities.
The first forum was organized by a group of enthusiastic students headed by 
Wilson Irungu Nyakera and Kwame Ansong-Dwamena. 

Though the theme has changed from year to year, 
the underlying motivation behind the forum hasn’t changed. 
The forum has always been aimed at creating awareness of the opportunities on the 
African continent and bring together Africans and friends of Africa from the continent 
and the diaspora to engage on the most important issues affecting the continent’s growth.
