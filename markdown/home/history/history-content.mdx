This year marks the 14th anniversary of the Africa Business Forum.
In 2007, the forum theme was “Fostering Entrepreneurial Activities in Africa”.
Its objective was to portray Africa in a more positive light than that more
commonly seen in the media and create awareness of the diverse and burgeoning opportunities.
The first forum was organized by a group of enthusiastic students headed by
Wilson Irungu Nyakera and Kwame Ansong-Dwamena.

Though the theme has changed from year to year,
the motivation behind the forum hasn’t changed.
The forum has always been aimed at creating awareness of the opportunities on the
African continent and bring together Africans and friends of Africa from the continent
and the diaspora to engage on the most important issues affecting the continent’s growth.
